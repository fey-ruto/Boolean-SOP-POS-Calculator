# README

## Introduction

This repository contains a Python program that allows users to calculate the Sum of Products (SOP) and Product of Sums (POS) expressions for a given Boolean function. The program prompts users to enter the degree of the function and a string of binary values representing the truth table of the function. It then calculates and displays the SOP and POS expressions based on the provided inputs.

## Importance and Value

- **Learning Tool**: This program serves as a valuable educational tool for students and professionals studying digital logic design, Boolean algebra, and related topics. It provides an interactive and practical way to learn about SOP and POS expressions and how they are derived from a truth table.

- **Boolean Function Analysis**: The program allows users to analyze Boolean functions by calculating their SOP and POS expressions. This analysis is crucial in digital circuit design and optimization, where such expressions are used to simplify circuits and improve performance.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The program features a user-friendly interface that guides users through the process of calculating SOP and POS expressions. It provides clear instructions and checks user inputs to ensure they are valid and within the specified range.

- **Flexible Design**: The program supports functions with degrees up to 4, making it suitable for a wide range of Boolean functions. This flexibility allows users to experiment with different functions and observe how the SOP and POS expressions change.

- **Interactive Display**: The program displays the truth table of the function, including the user-provided binary values, and the calculated SOP and POS expressions. This interactive display enhances understanding and provides immediate feedback to users.

## Usage

1. Run the program and follow the prompts.
2. Enter the degree of the function when prompted. The degree should be between 1 and 4.
3. The program will display the truth table with pre-filled values of variables.
4. Enter a string of binary values representing the truth table of the function.
5. The program will display the updated truth table with the user-provided values.
6. The program calculates and displays the SOP and POS expressions based on the user inputs.

## Conclusion

This program is a valuable tool for learning and analyzing Boolean functions. It provides an interactive and user-friendly experience for calculating SOP and POS expressions, making it a great addition to any digital logic design or Boolean algebra course.
